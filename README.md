# project2-dynamic-server
In this project, we were assigned to make a dynamically changing web server that used some sort of database that could relate to sustainability.
We chose to do ours on powerplants around the world. Using this kind of data, we could see how big of an impact certain kinds of powerplants had.
We could see how much energy output came from sustainable sources like wind, water, and nuclear powerplants. We could also see how many there were around the world. 
It really showed how much of an impact powerplants had, which in many cases was kind of unfortunate because it really showed just how many bad sources we had.
There were so many coal, gas, and oil plants, which was unsurprising, but unfortunate.

To run the program, you must clone or download the code, and then you will do an "npm install" in the command line to download the express framework, and sqlite3 database.
You will then run "node server.js" in the command line to run the program. Then you can open up a web browser and type localhost:8000 to get to the site.
When it opens up in a web browser you will see a graph and a table displaying the powerplant information. You can sort by a Country, a Powerplant type, or 
by how much energy the powerplant outputs. 

This project really related well to environmentalism and to sustainability, which was cool to do for a computer science project.
